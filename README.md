# leaflet-challenge

This is a project that explored visualization using Leaflet. I used a United States Geological Survey comprised of worldwide earthquake data. This data is updated every minute and includes earthquakes of all sizes around the world at any given time, https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. Once you choose the data that you want the website gives you a url to the JSON and that is how you incorporate it into your project. 

I choose to use the All Earthquakes in the past day" dataset. The languages/libraries used in the project were JavaScript, Leaflet, D3, HTML, CSS
